Frontend Mentor Challenge: Beginner

## Design-Plan

- For the header (we are creatives section), set background image, draw an arrow in CSS
- For the main body ('card-like sections'), I use the same workflow as cards
- Testimonials section should be interesting. Flexbox?
- Footer-images:grid/flexbox, contact section - a lot of alignment going on there.
- Mobile-first design -> Responsive UI

## Extra Credits

- Don't use JS

## What I'll Learn By Completing the Challenge

1. CSS Flexbox
2. CSS Media Queries -> Responsive Design
3. Working with images in websites.
4. Drawing with CSS (arrow on header section)
5. CSS on-hover
